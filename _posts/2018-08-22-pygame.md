This is a tutorial for making games with Python. The tutorial assumes that you have some prior knowledge of Python and programming in general. It will take you from the very beginning of making a game, all the way to the end, where you have a completed game.

The first step is getting PyGame. It is a module for Python that makes it easy to make games. You can install it using pip.

Note: In this article I’ll be using Python3, but if you are using the antique Python2, you don’t need to change any code. In fact, the only code difference I’ll make is the print statement.

The next thing that you need to do is create a new file, name it whatever you want (i’ll name it “game_example.py”), and open it with your text editor.

## Why PyGame

Before we get into the actual PyGame code, let’s talk about why you should use PyGame.

First of all, if you want to make games, you should use a game engine. A game engine is a piece of software that provides you with the tools to make games. These tools can be things like a rendering engine (for graphics), or they can be higher level abstractions like state machines and collision detection.

PyGame is not a full-featured game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine 4. But it doesn’t need to be. It’s designed to be simple and easy to use. It takes care of the low-level details for you so that you can focus on making your game.

Another reason to use PyGame is that it’s written in Python. Python is an easy language to learn and has many advantages over other languages when it comes to making games. For example, Python is very concise and readable. This means that your code will be shorter and easier to understand than if you were using another language like C++ or Java. And because Python is an interpreted language, it’s also very easy to test your code without having to recompile your entire project each time you make a change

## Install Pygame

```
pip install pygame

## Simple Example

```python
import pygame
import sys

pygame.init() # Initialize pygame
size = width, height = 320, 240 # Set the window size
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size) # Display the window

while True: # Dead-loop to make sure the window is always displayed
    for event in pygame.event.get(): # Iterate through all events
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # Exit if you click to close the window
            sys.exit()

pygame.quit() # exit pygame
```

## Load image

Let's take a look at how we can load an image with PyGame. The first thing we need to do is import the pygame library:

```python
import pygame
```

Then we need to load our image. We’ll use the PyGame function “load()” which takes an image file and returns us a Surface object. A Surface is just like a blank canvas that we can draw on.

```python
image = pygame.image.load("player.png")
```

Once we have our image, we need to create a Rectangle object for it. A Rectangle is just PyGame’s way of storing x, y, width, and height values for an object. We’ll use the PyGame function “get_rect()” which takes our image and returns us a Rectangle object with the correct values:

```python
rect = image.get_rect()
```

Then you can draw it to the csreen.

```python
screen.blit(image, rect) # draw the picture to the window
pygame.display.flip() # update the entire display
```

An example shown here:

```python
import pygame
import sys

pygame.init() # initialize pygame
size = width, height = 640, 480 # Set the window size
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size) # display window
color = (0, 0, 0) # set color
ball = pygame.image.load('car.jpg') # load image
ballrect = ball.get_rect() # Get the rectangular area

while True: # Dead-loop to make sure the window is always displayed
    for event in pygame.event.get(): # Iterate through all events
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # Exit if you click to close the window
            sys.exit()
    screen.fill(color) # fill the color (set to 0, execute this line of code or not)
    screen.blit(ball, ballrect) # draw the picture to the window
    pygame.display.flip() # update the entire display

pygame.quit() # Quit pygame
```

## Move image

You can use the *.move()* function to move the image around the screen. As parameter it takes a horizontal and vertical value.

```python
[2, 0] # Set the X-axis, Y-axis of movement
```

To make sure the game doesn't go to fast, use clock.tick() to make sure the image doesn't fly of the screen. 

Example:

```python
import sys
import pygame

pygame.init() # initialize pygame
size = width, height = 640, 480 # Set the window size
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size) # display window
color = (0, 0, 0) # set color
car = pygame.image.load('car.jpg') # load image
carrect = car.get_rect() # Get the rectangular area
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

speed = [2, 0] # Set the X-axis, Y-axis of movement
while True: # Dead loop to make sure the window is always displayed
    clock.tick(60) 

    for event in pygame.event.get(): # Iterate through all events
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # Quit if you click to close the window
            sys.exit()
    carrect = carrect.move(speed) # Move the car
    screen.fill(color) # fill the color (set to 0, execute this line of code is the same)
    screen.blit(car, carrect) # draw the image to the window
    pygame.display.flip() # update the entire display

pygame.quit() # Quit pygame
```


## Keyboard input

Anyone who has played games knows that the mouse and keyboard are indispensable input devices for games. The keyboard can control a limited number of directions and many command operations, while the mouse is to provide a full range of direction and position operations. 

So about the keyboard device

Use *pygame.event.get()* to get all the events, when *event.type == KEYDOWN* is called, you know a key is pressed. Use pygame.key.get_pressed() to get all pressed keys. Then simply call a function if a key is pressed.

```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
from sys import exit

def fire():
    print("K_SPACE")

def jump():
    print("K_UP")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pygame.init()

    win = pygame.display.set_mode((640,480),0,32)
    while True:
        pressed_keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type==QUIT:
                exit()

            if event.type==KEYDOWN:
                pressed_keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

            if pressed_keys[K_SPACE]:
                fire()

            if pressed_keys[K_UP]:
                jump()
```
